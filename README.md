# Python-Projects
Some of the Python projects I have completed while working towards a Computer Science degree.

weatherPlay - Uses Pyplot and Urllib libraries to retrieve temperatures on my birthday for the past 25 years and plots the highest temps on a graph.

foliumPlay - Uses Math, Pandas and Folium libraries to plot crashes in my neighborhood on my birthday on a map. Also plots wifi hotspots in Lehman College's neighborhood (indoor and outdoor).
